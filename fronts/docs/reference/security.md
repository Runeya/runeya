# Data Security: How Your Information Is Protected

We have implemented a robust encryption solution to ensure the security of your data. Hereâ€™s how it works:

## Generating a Secure Encryption Key
The application uses a single, securely generated encryption key to protect your data. This key is created using the **AEGIS-256** algorithm, recognized for its strength and reliability, and is securely stored within the application.

## Encrypting Data
When data is encrypted, we follow these steps:

1. **Creating a Unique Nonce**: Each encryption operation uses a unique value called a *nonce*. This ensures that encrypting the same data multiple times will never produce identical results. The uniqueness of the nonce adds an additional layer of security.

2. **Secure Encryption**: The data is encrypted using the **SecretBox** algorithm from libsodium, which combines symmetric encryption with authentication. This guarantees both the confidentiality and integrity of your data.

The encrypted output includes the nonce and the encrypted content, ensuring that decryption is secure and reliable.

## Decrypting Data
To decrypt your data, the application uses the single encryption key in combination with the unique nonce generated during the encryption process.  
1. We extract the nonce stored with the encrypted content.
2. We use the encryption key to restore your original data. If the nonce or encrypted content has been tampered with, decryption will automatically fail, ensuring the integrity of your data.

## Key Benefits of This Approach
- **Simplicity and Security**: Using a single encryption key simplifies management while maintaining robust security.
- **Unique Nonces**: Each encryption operation is unique, ensuring that no data can be "replayed" or encrypted identically.
- **Tamper Detection**: Any attempt to modify encrypted data will be detected and rejected.

In summary, our solution uses a single encryption key in combination with state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques to effectively protect your sensitive information.
